  Worldsemi WS2812 LED strip, nrfx PWM binding

  Driver bindings for controlling a WS2812 or compatible LED
  strip with a PWM output on a device with nrfx drivers.

  Use of this driver implies an ~16x internal memory overhead (16 bits of
  driver RAM overhead per bit of pixel data + 16 stop bits).

compatible: "worldsemi,ws2812-nrfx-pwm"

include: [base.yaml, ws2812.yaml]
